### Introduction

This project focuses on demonstrating the utility of the TidyVerse suite by using its packages to analyze and visualize real-world data. Specifically, we will explore the relationship between happiness levels and alcohol consumption across various countries.

#### Dataset Information

The data used in this analysis was sourced from Kaggle:

<https://www.kaggle.com/marcospessotto/happiness-and-alcohol-consumption?select=HappinessAlcoholConsumption.csv>

This dataset includes 122 countries and examines factors such as happiness scores and the average consumption of beer, wine, and spirits. We'll investigate if any patterns emerge between a country's happiness index and its alcohol intake.

The guiding question for this analysis: *Is there a measurable relationship between alcohol consumption and happiness?*

### Load Required Libraries

We begin by loading the necessary packages from the TidyVerse collection, which includes `ggplot2` for visualization, `dplyr` for data manipulation, and `tidyr` for data tidying.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

### Import and Preview Data

Next, we load the dataset directly from a GitHub repository. After reading the data, we'll explore the structure by displaying the first few rows and reviewing the column names to familiarize ourselves with the data.\

```{r}
# Load the dataset from GitHub
happiness_data <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shriyanshh/Week-9-TidyVerse-GitHub-CREATE-assignment/refs/heads/main/HappinessAlcoholConsumption.csv")

# View column names and first six rows of data
colnames(happiness_data)
head(happiness_data)

```

### Data Transformation with `dplyr` and `tidyr`

Before visualizing the data, we perform some transformations to make it more usable. We will:

-   **Create a new column** using `dplyr` to represent the total alcohol consumption per capita by summing beer, wine, and spirits consumption.
-   **Handle missing values** with `tidyr` by replacing any NA values in the newly created column with 0.

```{r}
# Use dplyr to create a new column for total alcohol consumption
happiness_data_clean <- happiness_data %>%
  mutate(TotalAlcohol = rowSums(select(., Beer_PerCapita, Spirit_PerCapita, Wine_PerCapita), na.rm = TRUE))

# Use tidyr to replace any missing values in the TotalAlcohol column with 0
happiness_data_clean <- happiness_data_clean %>%
  replace_na(list(TotalAlcohol = 0))

# Display the first few rows of the transformed dataset
head(happiness_data_clean)


```

### Explanation of the Code:

-   `mutate()`: This is part of `dplyr` and allows you to create or transform columns in the dataset. Here, we use `mutate()` to create the `TotalAlcohol` column by summing the `Beer_PerCapita`, `Spirit_PerCapita`, and `Wine_PerCapita` columns using the `rowSums()` function.

-   `select()`: This function, also from `dplyr`, is used inside `rowSums()` to select the relevant columns (beer, spirit, and wine consumption).

-   `replace_na()`: This function from `tidyr` is used to replace missing values in the `TotalAlcohol` column. We specify `na.rm = TRUE` in the `rowSums()` to ignore any NA values during the summation process, but in case there are any remaining NAs in the dataset, we replace them with 0 using `replace_na()`.

### Visualizing the Relationship with `ggplot2`

Next, we create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between total alcohol consumption and happiness scores. Each country is colored according to its region, and a linear regression line is added to show the overall trend.

```{r}
# Create a scatter plot using ggplot2
ggplot(happiness_data_clean, aes(x = HappinessScore, y = TotalAlcohol, color = Region)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship Between Alcohol Consumption and Happiness",
    subtitle = "Visualizing the data for 122 countries",
    x = "Happiness Score",
    y = "Total Alcohol Consumption per Capita"
  ) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "black")


```

### Interpretation of Results

The scatter plot above suggests a positive association between happiness and alcohol consumption. However, there is substantial variability in the data, implying that while a trend exists, it is not strongly deterministic.

Further analysis would be required to explore factors such as income levels, social structures, or cultural practices that may also influence these observations.

### Conclusion

This example has demonstrated the power of TidyVerse for cleaning, manipulating, and visualizing data. In particular, we used:

-   `dplyr` for creating new variables and manipulating the dataset

-   `tidyr` for handling missing values

-   `ggplot2` for visualizing the relationship between happiness and alcohol consumption

To conclude, while we can see a general trend, the data reveals substantial variation between different regions, necessitating further exploration to draw robust conclusions.
